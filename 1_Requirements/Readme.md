# Introduction


The objective of this project The Third Eye for the Blind is to design a product which is very much useful to those people who are visually impaired and those who often have to rely on others. Third eye for Blind project is an innovation which helps the visually impaired people to move around and go from one place to another with speed and confidence by knowing the nearby obstacles using the help of the wearable band which produces the ultrasonic waves which notify them with buzz sound or vibrations. It allows the user those who are visually impaired to walk freely by detecting the obstacles. They only need to wear this device as a band or cloth on their body. According to WHO or the World Health Organization, 39 million people are estimated as blinds worldwide. They are suffering a lot of hardship in their daily life. The physically disabled ones have been using the traditional way that is the white cane for many years which although being effective, still has a lot of disadvantages and limitations. Another way is, having a pet animal such as a dog, but it is really expensive. Thus the aim of the project Third eye for the Blind is to develop a cheap, affordable and more efficient way to help the blind people to navigate with greater comfort, speed and confidence. This is the wearable technology for the blinds which helps resolve all the problems of the existing technologies.
